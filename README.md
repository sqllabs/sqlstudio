# MySQL Studio

## Overview

MySQL Studio is the web front end for MySQL Audit.

## Roadmap

We follow MySQL’s official release roadmap. Whenever MySQL publishes a new
major version, this project upgrades as quickly as possible to support it—
for example, we target MySQL 8.4.x today and will move to MySQL 9.7.x as soon
as it becomes available.
