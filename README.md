# MySQL Studio

## Overview

MySQL Studio is a database operations platform focused exclusively on
MySQL, MariaDB, and Percona Server for MySQL, delivering streamlined
workflows and tooling for day-to-day administration.

## Roadmap

We follow MySQL’s official release roadmap. Whenever MySQL publishes a new
major version, this project upgrades as quickly as possible to support it—
for example, we target MySQL 8.4.x today and will move to MySQL 9.7.x as soon
as it becomes available.
